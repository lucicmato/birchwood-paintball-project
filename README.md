This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

**This project was custom-built as a commercial solution for a small business specializing in renting paintball fields.  
It is fully deployed and running in production, actively serving real customers.**

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ This application is a true demonstration of power, speed, scalability, and performance when combining **Next.js (React.js)** with **Tailwind CSS**, deployed on **Vercel**. ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

## Getting Started

## Next.js, Vercel Deployment & Future Backend Features

This project was built with **Next.js**, taking advantage of its core capabilities:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for real-time booking data
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for 'static' pages
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** to keep content updated without full rebuilds
- **Next/Image** for fast-loading, responsive images of events and facilities

The application is deployed on **Vercel**, providing:

- **One-click CI/CD deployment** with preview environments for each pull request
- **Global edge network** to serve users with minimal latency
- **Automatic caching & invalidation** for updated booking and event info
- **Instant rollbacks** to quickly revert changes if needed

### Database Ready & Extensible Backend

The system is ready for integration with a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase) to enable:

- Centralized booking and customer management
- User accounts with reservation history
- Dynamic pricing based on availability and demand
- Real-time event statistics for administrators

### Future Backend-Only Features

The architecture supports seamless development of backend-only functionalities such as:

- Private admin dashboards with secure API endpoints
- Automated email/SMS confirmations and reminders
- Integration with third-party payment providers
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for staff vs. admin users
- Background jobs for periodic maintenance and report generation

This project demonstrates expertise in **building scalable, high-performance booking platforms** that are ready for both frontend and backend feature growth.
